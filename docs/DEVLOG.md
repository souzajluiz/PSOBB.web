## 2026-10-16: map entries, texture addressing, motions, handedness

**Goal:** close the open map-rendering gaps from Phase 3.

**Method:**
- Read the decomp's map draw loop (`map_nrel_process_chunk_static_meshes` and the animated loop), the loader, the render-state setters and the camera/projection code. They served as a specification.
- Read two data tables straight from `PsoBB.exe`: `g_StandardRenderStateSetters` at `0xa218c0` and the D3D enum table at `0xa21944`.
- Checked every claim against all 175 `map_*n.rel` with throwaway scripts.
- Checked visually in a scratch three.js page.

**Findings:**
- **The "0x10224" entries are indirect objects.** Flag `0x200` means the entry points at a 0x10 record `{object, runtime ind-tex, runtime f32, i16 id}`; `id` selects a row of `map_*i.bin` (waterfall/water distortion parameters).
  - 403 such entries were skipped before. Another 236 had been "parsed" as garbage objects.
  - All 639 now resolve: jungle07 entries 108/109 are its waterfalls.
- **Not every entry is drawn.** The PC client skips:
  - `0x100` entries: drawn only into the seabed/`boss06` planar-reflection texture.
  - `0x200|0x400` entries without `0x80`: a GameCube-only hook that is empty on PC.
  - Animated entries without a motion.
  - Together that is 1955 entries. They are now kept out of `objects`. Rendered model count: 133488 → 132169.
- **Entry fields** that were "unknown u32" are now decoded:
  - `+4`/`+8` (static) and `+0x14`/`+0x18` (animated) are an effect slot (flag `0x20`) and a `.tam` texture-animation record (flag `0x40`).
  - Animated entries carry `NJS_MOTION`, current frame and frame step. 11954 motions decode (position/angle/scale keys).
- **Texture address modes:** the table read from the exe maps 0 → clamp, 1 → mirror, 2/3 → wrap, and UV ranges in the data confirm it. `MaterialCache` now gives each (texture, wrapS, wrapT) its own `THREE.Texture` clone.
- **Material type 5:** the diffuse color becomes the constant vertex color of meshes without vertex colors. It never occurs in maps.
- **Material type 7:** camera-space texgen (environment map). It is parsed but not rendered.
- **Handedness: no mirroring.** The client's view and projection matrices are both right-handed (`LookAtRH`, `PerspectiveFovRH`), its rotations are standard, and the Pioneer 2 shop banners read correctly in our render.

**Open:**
- Apply motions (an AnimationMixer in the viewer).
- `.tam` texture animation, UV-scroll effect slots, env-map texgen, indirect-texture distortion.
- The section rotation order in `mapviewer.ts` should be `YXZ` (client `ZXY_ANG` mode); this only matters for two crater sections.

## 2026-10-16: classic UI, title screen

**Goal:** the title, login and character screens must look identical to the original client.

**Reference:**
- The psobb.io macOS build (a Wine wrapper) was pointed at the local newserv. It reads `LoginHost` / `PatchHost` from `psobb.cfg`; the original file is backed up as `psobb.cfg.psobbio-original`.
- Reference captures were taken with `screencapture` while driving the client with keystrokes: title, patch notice, SELECT CHARACTER, character creation, the "Connecting.." warp.
- The captures stay local (`client/public/ref/`, ignored by git).

**Findings:**
- The UI font is Tahoma: the client's `font_tahoma.reg` sets `FONT_JPN=Tahoma`.
- Loose files in `data/` override `data.gsl` entries; `ClientFiles` resolves names the same way.
- The BB title is `title.prs`. `title_eng.prs` is the GameCube Episode I&II title, and `TitleEP4.prs` is the Episode 4 variant.
- `title.prs` layout:
  - 0: "PRESS ENTER KEY" and menu labels.
  - 1–2: logo layers.
  - 3–10: background, 640×512 in tiles.
  - 11: magic circle.
  - 12: rings.
  - 13–20: background with the strong flare.
- The UI is laid out in a 640×480 virtual screen stretched to the window. `Stage` reproduces this with a Canvas2D transform.

**Matching method:**
- `window.classicCapture()` renders the stage at 2880×1800 and posts it to a dev-only `/__capture` endpoint.
- `tools/compare.sh` reports SSIM/PSNR (ffmpeg) against the capture, globally or per region.
- Parameters were chosen by grid search:
  - The flare layer drawn opaque was best on the left background (SSIM 0.83 → 0.90).
  - Circle: 385 px, centered at (345, 256), rotated -0.2 rad.
  - An additive beam with rays was added.
- Result: SSIM 0.716 → 0.732 and PSNR 18.8 → 19.4 for the whole frame. The remaining gap is mostly the beam/ray effect and the circle's glow.

**Note:** Chrome throttles requestAnimationFrame to 2 fps while its window is covered by another app. That is not a client bug; bring the window to the front when measuring.

## 2026-10-16: character creation and the lobby

**Method:** walked the flow live with a Node script against newserv, logging every command, then wrote `Lobby` and the session steps from what came back. Struct offsets come from newserv's `CommandFormats.hh` / `PlayerSubordinates.hh`.

**What landed:**
- **Session:** `BBSession.createCharacter` (E5 → E4) and `BBSession.enterLobby` (93 phase 4 → 07 menu → 10 "Go to lobby" → 67).
- **`Lobby`:** player roster (67/68/69), chat (06), movement subcommands (6x1F/20/3E/3F/40/42), with automatic 6x20 replies to 6x1F.
- **Lobby view:**
  - Loads `map_lobby_NNn.rel` for the lobby number.
  - Players are class-colored capsules with name tags.
  - Third-person camera.
  - WASD running sends 6x42 every 150 ms and 6x3E on release.
  - Ground height comes from a raycast against the render mesh.
- **Online tab:** slot cards with Create / Play, a creation form (name, class, live section ID), the lobby with player list and chat.

**Tests:**
- `tests/lobby.live.ts` runs two clients: A sees B join (68), B gets A's chat, run, stop and angle, and A sees B leave (69). 7/7 pass.
- `tests/bot.live.ts` is a bot that circles the first player and echoes chat.

**Verified in Chrome:** login → Play → lobby 1 rendered with the bot running around; chat round trip "hello bot" → "echo: hello bot". No console errors.

**Open:**
- The section ID uses the community formula (sum of name chars mod 10); confirm it against the client.
- Spawn points are approximated (first floor found near the origin).

## 2026-10-16: map viewer

**What landed:**
- **Parsers:** REL, Ninja object trees with XJ models, the "fmt2" map `n.rel`, and XVM textures (software-decoded DXT1/DXT3/16-bit, including Xbox unswizzling).
- **Viewer:** a three.js map viewer tab with orbit and WASD camera, reading data from a picked folder or from the Vite dev endpoint `/psobb-data`.

**How the formats were worked out:**
- The decomp's map loader notes gave the `n.rel` header: section count at +8, sections at +0x10, NJTL at +0x14, 0x34-byte sections with sub-arrays at +0x20/+0x28 and +0x24/+0x2C.
- The rest came from hex-walking `map_city00_00n.rel`: 16-byte static entries, the NJS_OBJECT and XJ model layouts, vertex types 4, 5 and 7, and material records whose type numbers line up with the client's render-state setter table.
- XVR formats were surveyed across all 203 `.xvm` files: bytes per texel 0.5 means DXT1, 1 means DXT3, and 2 means 16-bit. The flags turned out to be a mipmaps bit (×4/3 size) and an alpha bit.

**Tests:**
- `tests/formats.test.ts` parses all 175 `n.rel` maps (133,488 models) and all 203 `.xvm` archives (7,821 textures).
- 16 Episode 2 maps initially failed. Their entries with flags `0x10224` point at non-object records, so they are now skipped and counted (403 entries total).

**Verified in Chrome:**
- Pioneer 2 (`map_city00_00`): 185 meshes, 15,843 triangles, 246 textures.
- Forest 1: 631 meshes, 24,152 triangles.
- Also loaded: Jungle 7 and Seabed 2. No console errors.

**Security:** the dev endpoint rejects path traversal (`..%2F` gets 403) and only exists in `vite dev`, which is bound to 127.0.0.1.

## 2026-10-16: login in Chrome

**What landed:**
- **Vite + TypeScript client** (`client/`): login form, character slots and a live protocol log.
- **`BBSession`:** full data-server login, i.e. `03` → `93` → `E6` → `19` redirect → reconnect → `93` (with guild card, token and client config) → `E6`, then `E3` per slot → `E4`/`E5`.
- **Key file:** Vite serves the `.nsk` from the local newserv checkout at `/keys/`, so it is never committed.

**Bug found in Chrome:** `E6` and `19` arrived in the same WebSocket message. `waitFor(0x19)` was registered only after `await waitFor(0xE6)` resumed, and by then the `19` had already been dispatched. `BBConnection` now keeps a backlog of unclaimed commands.

**Verified in Chrome:** login as `webtest` gets guild card 2122363817 and four empty slots (`E4`).

## 2026-10-16: foundation

**Starting point:** the `psobb-master` folder was the 2015 Tethealla server (Windows binaries and server data only, no client). The plan: switch the server to newserv and reimplement the client for the browser.

**Environment:**
- **REA MCP:** failed because the default Node was v16 and `rea-agents@6.4.0` needs ≥ 22.19. Fixed by pointing the MCP config at Node v24.18.
- **newserv:** `phosg`, `resource_dasm` and `newserv` built into `vendor/` with a local prefix. Nothing installed system-wide besides `brew install asio libiconv`.
- **Client:** the Ephinea installer was extracted with `7zz`, never executed. Maps live in `data/scene/`; spawn `.dat` files live in `data.gsl`.

**TS ports, all verified against the newserv CLI:**
- `BBCrypt`: ciphertext byte-identical to `newserv encrypt-data --bb` (keys `default` and `default4`).
- `prsDecompress`: 19 real files identical. `chatsensor.prs` is rejected by both newserv and the port.
- `GSLArchive`: 1524 entries, the same count as `newserv extract-gsl`, with identical content.

**Live login through the bridge:**
- **Bug 1, race:** `03` arrived before `BBConnection` installed its handler. The transport now queues early data.
- **Bug 2, framing:** the cleartext `03` is not padded to 8 bytes. Only encrypted commands are padded.
- **Result:** `E6 error_code=0`, then `19` (redirect). Login OK.
